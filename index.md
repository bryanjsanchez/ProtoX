## Introduction

ProtoX is a programming language whose purpose is to provide a framework to solve complex scenarios when decisions are vital to resolving the conflict. We create a programming language to simplify the development of surgery protocols in hospitals.

### Language Features

The language has three types of “objects”: hospitals, procedures and protocols. A hospital can perform many different procedures and each procedure has associated protocols. Our ProtoX language can perform the following operations:


```language
-Create/delete a hospital.
-Show all hospitals.
-Add a procedure that is done to each hospital.
-Fetch the list of protocols related to a procedure.
-Fetch the list of protocols by hospital depending on which procedures they offer.
-List the procedures done in each hospital for all procedures.
-Create/delete a protocol.
-Edit an existing protocol.
-Assign a protocol to a procedure.
-Remove protocol from a procedure.
```
