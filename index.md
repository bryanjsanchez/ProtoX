## Introduction

ProtoX is a programming language whose purpose is to provide a framework to solve complex scenarios when decisions are vital to resolving the conflict. We create a programming language to simplify the development of surgery protocols in hospitals.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.
